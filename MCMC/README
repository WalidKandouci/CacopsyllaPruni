Notes for trajectories Jun7_0812...

1) Output from four rounds of 1E5 iterations, first set with thin=10, then sets 2-3 with thin=100

2) Serveral rounds of 1E5 iterations were run prior to these for convergence

3) Trajectories show how the adaptive sampler 'wakes up' - i.e. variance in samples suddenly jumps up.
